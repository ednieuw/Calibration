      <p class="style1">In a slope ratio assay the responses of dilutions of a 
	  standard are compared with the responses of dilutions of a test sample.<br>
      The doses (dilutions) are linear distributed, this in contrast with the 
	  parallel line assay (PLA) where the logarithm of the doses is linear 
	  distributed.<br>
      With the SRA the lines of the standard and sample must intersect at the 
	  reponse of the blank. <br>
      A linear line is calculated through the dose-response points for the 
	  standard with the equation:<br>
      Response = Sa * dosis + intercept <br>
      And for the test sample as:<br>
	  Response = Ta * dosis + intercept&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style1">The two lines have an intersection point at dosis = 0 â€” 
	  the intercept is identical in both equations.<br>
      The ratio of Sa/Ta is used to calculate the potency of the test sample. 
	  SRA if often used in reaction rate test where the measuring intervals are 
	  close together at the start of the reaction. D.J. Finney was one of the 
	  first mathematicians who described SRA in detail.</p></td>

	Microsoft Excel and is an copy of the method described by D.J. Finney 
	<br>Two versions are available.<br>Version 1 march 2009 uses no Visual basic 
	macro's but in this version one can not see what responses are omitted.<br>
      In version 31 march 2009 a Visual Basic macro tests if responses are in 
	italic and/or bold and does not use these marked entries. The advantage is 
	obvious; one can see the deleted entries and one can include or exclude 
	points in the calculation easily by marking them.<br>
    Excel does not recalculate a sheet when a font is changed. Therefore one has 
	to force a recalculation by pressing F2 followed by Enter. </p>
